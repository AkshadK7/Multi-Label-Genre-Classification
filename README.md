# Multi-Label Genre Classification

A TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) Approach to Multi-Label Genre Classification on Movie Posters.

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to perform multi-label genre classification of movie posters. The model analyzes visual features of movie posters to predict multiple genres associated with each movie.
